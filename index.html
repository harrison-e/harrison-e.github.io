      My name is Harrison and I am studying Computer Science at Northeastern University. The focus of my study is computer systems, but I enjoy learning about all sorts of computer hardware and software. I'm currently working at <a href="https://tuniklab.sites.northeastern.edu/">Northeastern's Movement Neuroscience Lab,</a> as a neurostimulation engineer co-op.
