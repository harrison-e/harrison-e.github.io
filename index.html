      <h1 style="text-align:center">About me</h1>
      <p>
      My name is Harrison and I am studying Computer Science at Northeastern University. The focus of my study is computer systems, but I enjoy learning about all sorts of computer hardware and software. I'm currently working at <a href="https://tuniklab.sites.northeastern.edu/">Northeastern's Movement Neuroscience Lab</a> as a neurostimulation engineer co-op, where I head the use of a real-time Linux/C++ interface for communicating with analog medical devices to facilitate a variety of neuroscience experiments.

      <h2>Content Delivery Network</h2>
      <p>
      Developed and deployed a functional CDN for HTTP requests, written in Python. Successfully distributed custom HTTP and DNS server programs among remote machines, using scripts. Leveraged dynamic caching algorithm to minimize both client latency and repeat requests to main server for popular content. <br>

      <h2>Predicting the Outcome of Penalty Kicks</h2>
      <p>
      Implemented a neural network to predict the outcome of a penalty kick in a game of soccer, using PyTorch and OpenCV libraries. Programatically estimated pose data from curated dataset of FIFA videos, and used said data to train a neural network. <br>

      <h2>Photomosaic Generator and Image Processor</h2>
      <p>
      <b>Photomosaic Generator:</b> Expanded upon image processor to allow the creation of a photomosaic, given a base image file and a directory of images to use as a tileset. Implemented AVL tree to organize tileset, keying on average RGB, to find closest tile match for any given segment of the base image. <br>
      <b>Image Processor:</b> Built on C stb image library to allow editing of .png, .jpg, and .bmp image files, via CLI. Includes an implementation of Pointillism Art algorithm <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Create-Pointillism-Art-from-Digital-Images-Analysis-Hong-Liu/a0c7e67fa6201fac80eda4d4f7fd1023ce6c7cbf">(link to PDF).</a><br>
